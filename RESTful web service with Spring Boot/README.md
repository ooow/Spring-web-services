RESTful web service with Spring Boot
====================================
execution of requests to the database from a remote server
* get request 
* put request (JSON format)
* delete request


I advise you to use a web developers helper program to create and test custom HTTP requests:
* Advanced REST client (extension chrome) 
URL - http://localhost:8080/
